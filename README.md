# Ray

## CSS

Ray has been built on top of Bootstrap so includes the entire Bootstrap CSS with variables changed to match the Ray style guide.

Please refer to the [Bootstrap documention](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) to get started.

### Custom Styles

These are the styles that Ray introduces that are not part of Bootstrap.
In most cases, these add additional modifiers that extend the base Bootstrap classes.

#### Background colours

There is a `bg-gray-` class for each of the values in the grays map (from 100 - 900).

#### Rounded corners

There are 4 `rounded` border radius variations.  These are 1, 2, 3 and 4x the base border radius value.
